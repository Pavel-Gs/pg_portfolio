# PG's portfolio

Here I've collected all of my student projects (both of them, haha) and organized them via cards, with links and descriptions. The card's info is stored in the remote *.json file, which is fetched and mapped when loaded.

## Technologies used
### `React library`
Mapping/iterating through the components, a bit of prop drilling as well. Also, useState and useEffect hooks are used extensively, which allows for the dynamic seamless update of the content.

### `React-router-dom`
As far as I'm aware, there is no way to create routes natively in React. But there are libraries, which can provide that functionality. React-router is one of them.

### `SASS`
I prefer to use SASS instead of regular CSS, primarily due to the nesting capability (at the moment of making that app, "styled react components" did not have full VSCode support).

## Integrations
### `Normalized CSS`
CSS resets. From the official description: "Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing."

### `FormSubmit`
As the name suggests, that integration provides easy form-submission functionality and automated replies.

### `Font Awesome`
Provides various icons and symbols, which could be styled right in the code.
