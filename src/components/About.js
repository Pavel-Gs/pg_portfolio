		<p>Hey, I'm Pavel - a geomatics engineer... Or rather I was, for 15 years. But a long story short - my goal now, is to change my career to Web Development.</p>
		<p>Front-end technologies I'm working with are rather typical - JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, SASS. Being a beginner in a new industry, I totally realize, how much I still have to learn...</p>
		<p>Or should I, perhaps, rewrite the sentence and say: "I don't even realize yet the full depth of coding"?</p>
		<p>But the learning process must never stop. So, if you wish, revisit this site in a few weeks - there might be a new project posted in the "projects" section.</p>
